    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or qualitative data into a numerical representation that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is a fundamental step in data preprocessing and feature engineering. Encoding is useful in data science because most machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, and encoding allows us to transform categorical variables into a format that can be understood by these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. An example of using nominal encoding is in a scenario where we have a \"Color\" feature with categories like \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green.\" We can assign numerical labels to these categories, such as 0 for \"Red,\" 1 for \"Blue,\" and 2 for \"Green.\" The encoded values allow us to represent the categorical data numerically, making it easier to work with in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when there is an inherent order or rank among the categories in a variable. For example, in a \"Education Level\" feature with categories like \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" and \"Master's Degree,\" there is a natural ordering based on the level of education. In this case, nominal encoding can assign numerical labels like 0, 1, and 2 to represent the increasing order of education levels. One-hot encoding, on the other hand, would create separate binary columns for each category, which would not capture the ordinal relationship among the categories. Nominal encoding is more suitable when preserving the order or rank is important for the analysis or modeling task at hand."

    "Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding\n",
    "technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the categorical data has no inherent order or ranking, and all categories are equally important, I would choose the one-hot encoding technique to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, representing the presence or absence of that category in a given observation. Each unique category is assigned its own column, and a value of 1 is placed in the corresponding column if the category is present, and 0 otherwise. This encoding preserves the categorical information without imposing any ordinality or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using one-hot encoding, we avoid assigning numerical labels or arbitrary values to the categories, which could introduce unintended relationships or interpretations. It allows the machine learning algorithm to treat each category as a distinct and independent feature. This technique ensures that the categorical data is properly represented numerically and can be used effectively by various machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, among others."

    "To transform the categorical data in the customer churn dataset (gender and contract type) into numerical data, we can use the following encoding techniques:\n",

    "For the \"gender\" feature: Since there are only two unique categories (male and female), we can use label encoding. Assigning the labels 0 and 1 to the respective categories would be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"contract type\" feature: If there are more than two unique categories, we can use one-hot encoding. For example, if the \"contract type\" has three categories (month-to-month, one-year, two-year), we would create three new binary columns, one for each category. Each column will represent whether the customer has a particular contract type (1) or not (0).\n",
