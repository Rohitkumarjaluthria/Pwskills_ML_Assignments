    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting lies in how the infrastructure is managed and the scalability and flexibility offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional web hosting, a website or web application is hosted on a single physical server or a dedicated server. The resources of that server, such as computing power, storage, and memory, are allocated solely to the hosted application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional hosting typically involves a fixed cost and a fixed set of resources. The website or application is limited by the capacity of the single server it is hosted on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling resources in traditional hosting often requires manual intervention, such as upgrading hardware or adding more servers, which can lead to downtime during the scaling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional hosting is suitable for static websites or applications with predictable and steady traffic, where resource requirements are well understood and can be accommodated by a single server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "In cloud hosting, the website or application is hosted on a distributed network of virtual servers, typically provided by a cloud service provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting offers scalability and flexibility as resources can be dynamically allocated based on demand. Multiple virtual servers can be added or removed easily to match the changing traffic patterns and resource needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where users are charged based on the actual resources used. This allows for cost optimization as users only pay for the resources consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting offers high availability and redundancy as the infrastructure is distributed across multiple servers and data centers. If one server or data center fails, the workload can be seamlessly transferred to another without affecting the availability of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting provides additional services and features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and automated backups, which simplify the management and maintenance of the hosted application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud hosting is well-suited for dynamic websites, scalable web applications, and businesses that experience variable or unpredictable traffic patterns."
